# Javascript_Tutorials

Breaking the read me file into sections that correlate to the folders in the repo of what i have done.

## Tree Nodes
Tree Nodes, is about me reinforcing the stuff i have learnt from uni in java and implying it to the javascript, i started of by using a pre written BST and 
change it to be able to visualise it in html. The article (https://medium.com/swlh/binary-search-tree-in-javascript-31cb74d8263b) i used, which contained
a non recursive add method. I used that to visual the outcome of what html will look like. Then i wrote my own recursive method for adding into the tree.

The reason why i wanted to pre-wrriten method was to see how i should approach this challenge, coming from java and taking it to the javascript i wanted to learn
how to construct classess and constructors better.

![Mine BST](https://github.com/CurlzG/Javascript_Tutorials/blob/main/TreeNodes/BST%20Mine.PNG)

The difference between mine and Medium article is that, medium started inside of the class function that meant that it could get the value and mine was 
initilized outside first.

### Future Goals
1. Explore More of the trees
2. Make the visualization better
3. Flush out and make my code cleaner
4. Make the page more interactive
5. See if i can match the Medium to Mine closer (get rid of the 0)
